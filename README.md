# STATS220 Repo
## Why does this repo exist?
* As of writing this, I am a student at the University of Auckland, and I am studying Statistics. 
* Never did I think I'd be learning to animate and link gifs.
* *So really this is a treat for* `me the writer`, *and* `you the reader!` **Aren't you lucky**

### Ode to you
1. Follow me on this trip
2. In my magic rocket ship (`github`)
3. Zooming through the web
4. Progressing from a pleb
5. Maybe you will see magic
6. But I imagine it'll be quite tragic
7. Data Technology
8. Data Technology

### Keen to follow my shameless photography plug?
* I plan to create a data set based on interaction success with different posting times, color use, locations and collaborations. Hopefully I will then be able to create a time series and begin to understand how different artistic choices I make influences interaction and success.
